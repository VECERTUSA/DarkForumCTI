specialized investigative framework to investigate cases of malicious actors in the OSINT and backup dark forums.

This is a backup of the "illegal data sales and leaks" room carried out by various actors from different countries. You can search by "actor name" or "post title" to obtain a list of the records we have.

We also have the list of users in "JSON" format in CSV format. We have also added email existence validators for Proton and X services that validate the existence of emails, adding a public profile and the possible existence of a username, sharing links for username investigation.

Content to help those affected and map digital crime.
